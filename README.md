Sushi Restaurant

This is a business website for a fictional Sushi Restaurant. For this class project, the main focus was to understand the structure of a website and learn how to code webpages in HTML & CSS. In this class project, I designed the layout of the webpages in Adobe XD and then coded the responsive design in HTML & CSS.
